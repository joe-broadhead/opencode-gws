/**
 * `calendar.today`, the read Jelly's native calendar makes (hey-jelly `docs/architecture/plugin-native-data.md`).
 *
 * Jelly calls a view's method on the RPC registered under the package's own name, through its core plugin's relay,
 * with the input the method declares: `{}`. The host judges the declared permission, `gws.read`, against the agent's
 * rules before the call reaches the plugin; an RPC call carries no session, so the plugin cannot assert it itself.
 * The method reads only through the plugin's own read path (`runtime.read`: the account's own sign-in, the read
 * policy, the audit), never downloads gws, and never writes.
 *
 * One account answers (`calendarAccount`). Its primary calendar's own time zone sets today's bounds. A good answer
 * is kept in memory: a call within FRESH_MS of it is answered from it, and when a later read fails for any reason
 * but the sign-in, the kept events of the same day come back as `stale`, with the time they were read. An answer
 * over 60 KB of JSON leaves out its latest-starting events until it fits (Jelly refuses one over 64 KB); the audit
 * records how many as a `calendar.today` record's `omitted`.
