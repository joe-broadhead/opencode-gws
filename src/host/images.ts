/**
 * `images.read`, the read Jelly makes to draw a Google picture in an agent's UI (hey-jelly
 * `backend/host/src/agent-ui/image-route.ts`). Jelly sends the element's address, `{ url }`, only to the plugin whose
 * `imageHosts` name its host, after judging the declared permission, `gws.read`, against the agent's rules: an RPC
 * call carries no session, so the plugin cannot ask itself. Jelly never sees the token.
 *
 * - A Drive link (`drive.google.com`) is never fetched. Its file id is read through gws, as the account: the file's
 *   `mimeType`, `size` and `thumbnailLink`, then, for a PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP of at most 1 MB, its bytes
 *   (`alt=media`, in a private staging directory removed before the answer). Any other file answers its thumbnail.
 * - Any other address must be on one of Google's image servers (`PICTURE_SERVERS`), and is fetched over HTTPS by
 *   `fetchImage`. The account's token goes with it only when Google returned that exact address to the account in
 *   this process (`ImageSources`), as a Drive file's `thumbnailLink` is. Otherwise it is fetched without credentials.
 * - The answer's `mime` comes from the bytes, never from a header or Drive's `mimeType`; SVG and every other kind are
 *   refused. A picture over 1 MB is refused, never cut short.
 * - Nothing is kept: no bytes in memory after the call, and no address in an error, a log or the audit.
