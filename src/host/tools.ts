/**
 * The gws tool surface. Each tool is a thin adapter: validate with its
 * contract schema, assert the OpenCode permission, call the runtime, and
 * return `{ output, content, metadata }`. Code Mode receives `output` as a
 * typed object; a direct call shows the bounded `content` text.
 *
 * Exposure: status, catalog, schema, and plan are Code Mode tools, with
 * catalog and plan pinned so the model sees them without a search. read is
 * a direct tool, so each read is a call a host can show: Jelly draws a
 * Gmail thread from it (views/gmail-thread.html), and a read made inside a
 * Code Mode script is invisible to it. The six commit tools are direct
 * tools (codemode: false): each commit is one visible step the user
 * approves, and a decline ends that step instead of becoming an error a
 * program can catch and work around.
 *
 * The specs are the one definition of each tool. The tools RPC
 * (`scripting.ts`) runs the same specs for scripts, with the same
 * permission asserts: every tool except the six commit tools is a method.
