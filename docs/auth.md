# Sign-in

Unofficial plugin. Not affiliated with Google.

An interactive account signs in through OpenCode: run `/connect` and choose **Google Workspace**, or run `opencode auth login gws-<alias>`. With more than one interactive account, each entry is named **Google Workspace (`<alias>`)**. With no `accounts` option the alias is `default`.

In the TUI, `/connect` shows the sign-in link: press `o` or Enter to open it in your browser. The CLI, `opencode auth login gws-<alias>`, opens the browser automatically. With no `accounts` option, the `default` account enables every service the plugin covers except Keep, and the form starts on Read and write, which needs the acknowledgment; Read-only is the other choice. An account you configure without `access` starts on Read-only. The form lists the exact scopes before Google's consent screen.

Headless accounts do not use this flow. `credentials_file` reads a credentials file from the environment variable named by `credentialsFileEnv`. `access_token` reads a token from `tokenEnv`. Neither is a fallback. `/gws-doctor` is what checks them.

The plugin writes no credential file. Tokens stay in OpenCode's credential store. Refresh uses the client stored with that sign-in.

## The form

The form renders before authentication starts.

| Field | When it shows | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth client ID, OAuth client secret | When no `oauthClient` option sets a client. | The ID and secret of your Desktop app client. Leave both blank to reuse the client from this account's previous sign-in. When `oauthClient` is set (for example by organisation config), both fields are hidden and submit the option's values. The host refuses a malformed ID or secret before any network call. |
| Access | Always | **Read-only** or **Read and write**. It starts on the account's configured access: Read and write for the implicit `default` account, Read-only for an account without `access`. Each option's description lists the scope URLs it will request. An account whose config sets `access` to read, with no write service, does not offer write. |
| I understand this grants write access | Required when Access is Read and write | The acknowledgment. Without it the sign-in stops with `AUTH_WRITE_UNCONFIRMED`. |
| OAuth client JSON, OAuth redirect URI, OAuth callback port | Never: a host fills them | Google's downloaded client JSON (it replaces the client ID and secret), and the `redirectUri` and `callbackPort` of [a sign-in from another machine](#sign-in-when-opencode-runs-on-another-machine). The redirect fields default to the plugin options of the same names. |

If Google shows `redirect_uri_mismatch` with the default loopback redirect, the client is not a Desktop app. With a `redirectUri`, the Web application client does not list it exactly; the sign-in instructions name the redirect.

## OAuth client

No Google OAuth client ships with the plugin. Each sign-in uses your own Desktop app client, or the one your organisation sets through `oauthClient`. Google treats a Desktop client's secret as non-confidential. Security does not rest on the secret. It rests on PKCE (S256), the loopback redirect to `127.0.0.1`, and the user's consent on Google's screen.

`oauthClient` is `{ "clientId", "clientSecret" }` for a Desktop app client, or the JSON Google Cloud console downloads for a client: `{ "installed": … }` for a Desktop app, `{ "web": … }` for a Web application, which keeps its `redirect_uris`. A Web client works only with a host-supplied redirect (below), and its secret is confidential.

Precedence, first match wins:

1. `accounts.<alias>.oauthClient`
2. the plugin `oauthClient` (organisation managed config)
3. the client ID and secret entered in the `/connect` form
4. the client entered at the previous sign-in, when the fields are left blank

With none of these, the sign-in stops with `AUTH_CLIENT_REQUIRED`, and status says: run `/connect` and choose Google Workspace, then enter your Desktop OAuth client ID and secret, or ask your administrator.

Set `oauthClient` in user, project, or system config. An organisation client of user type **Internal** serves only that Workspace organisation. Do not put a client secret in a chat, a skill, or a commit message.

## Create your Desktop client

`/gws-status` gives the API link for each account that has no client yet.

1. **Create a project.** In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate), create a project, or pick one you own.
2. **Enable the APIs.** Enable the API of each service the account uses. `/gws-status` gives one link per account, built from `enabledServices`.
3. **Set up the consent screen.** Open [Google Auth platform → Branding](https://console.developers.google.com/auth/branding) and fill in the app name and your email. Under [Audience](https://console.developers.google.com/auth/audience), choose **Internal** if the project belongs to your Workspace organisation. For **External**, add yourself as a test user; in **Testing** status Google expires refresh tokens after 7 days. Setting the app **In production** avoids that expiry, at the cost of an unverified-app warning on the consent screen.
4. **Create a Desktop client.** Under [Clients](https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients), create a client of type **Desktop app**. A Web client does not work with the loopback redirect.
5. **Copy its ID and secret.** Copy the client ID (`….apps.googleusercontent.com`) and the client secret, then run `/connect`, choose Google Workspace, and enter them. Choose the access: every change still needs a plan and your approval.

Then run `/gws-doctor`. It makes one small read per enabled service and reports `OK`, `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `AUTH_SCOPE_MISSING`, `ADMIN_PRIVILEGE_REQUIRED` (a valid sign-in of an account without the admin privilege, such as Reports for `admin-reports`), or `API_DISABLED` with the enable URL. A service it cannot check, such as Keep without delegation, is `SKIPPED` with the reason.

## Sign in when OpenCode runs on another machine

By default Google sends the browser back to `http://127.0.0.1:<random port>`, where the sign-in listens. That works only when the browser and OpenCode are on the same computer. When OpenCode runs on a server and the person signs in from a browser elsewhere, the host that serves OpenCode supplies the redirect:

- `redirectUri`: the absolute URL Google redirects to, for example `https://host.example/oauth/return`. It must be `https`, unless it points at `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]` or `localhost`.
- `callbackPort`: the port on `127.0.0.1` where the sign-in listens. The host forwards Google's redirect, path and query unchanged, to `http://127.0.0.1:<callbackPort><path of redirectUri>`.

Set them as plugin options, or let the host fill the hidden form fields of the same names for one sign-in; a filled field wins over its option. `redirectUri` needs `callbackPort`. `callbackPort` alone keeps a loopback redirect, on that fixed port.

The authorize URL and the token exchange then carry `redirectUri`. The listener accepts only the redirect's path, with the same state and PKCE checks, and only once. Without either setting, nothing changes.

Google accepts only loopback redirects for a Desktop app client, so a public redirect needs a **Web application** client:

1. Under [Clients](https://console.developers.google.com/auth/clients), create a client of type **Web application**, and add the exact `redirectUri` under **Authorised redirect URIs**.
2. Download its JSON and give it to the sign-in: in the form's hidden **OAuth client JSON** field, filled by the host, or as `oauthClient`.

Before the browser opens, the sign-in refuses with `AUTH_REDIRECT_MISMATCH` a Desktop client with a non-loopback redirect, and a Web client whose `redirect_uris` do not include `redirectUri`. A malformed redirect or port is `AUTH_REDIRECT_INVALID`.

A Web client's secret is confidential. The plugin keeps it with the sign-in in OpenCode's credential store, never puts it in the form, a status, a tool result or an error, and redacts it from token errors. Prefer the form field to `oauthClient`: a config file is a file an agent's tools may read.

Google matches a non-loopback redirect exactly, character for character, so every public address must be registered on the Web client. A deployment with many hosts registers each one, or uses one relay address that forwards each callback to the right host.

## What the default consent asks for

The `default` account at Read and write requests every scope in the table below's Read and write column, plus the identity scopes: 42 scopes in one consent, under Google's limit of 64 per request. Read-only requests 35 for the same services, only read-only scopes, and runs every read that accepts a read-only scope; the few reads listed below as needing Read and write accept no read-only scope.

- **Granular consent.** Google lists the scopes with a checkbox each. A scope you untick is not granted; `/gws-status` and `gws_status` list it under missing scopes, and the methods that need it fail with `AUTH_SCOPE_MISSING` until you sign in again and approve it.
- **External client in Testing.** Many of these scopes are sensitive or restricted (Gmail, Drive, and others). An External client shows Google's unverified-app warning for them, only its test users can sign in, and in Testing status Google expires its refresh tokens after 7 days, so you sign in again every week. An Internal client in your own Workspace organisation avoids all three.
- **APIs to enable** in the client's Cloud project, one per service: Gmail (`gmail.googleapis.com`), Drive (`drive.googleapis.com`), Calendar (`calendar-json.googleapis.com`), Docs (`docs.googleapis.com`), Sheets (`sheets.googleapis.com`), Slides (`slides.googleapis.com`), Tasks (`tasks.googleapis.com`), People (`people.googleapis.com`), Chat (`chat.googleapis.com`), Classroom (`classroom.googleapis.com`), Forms (`forms.googleapis.com`), Meet (`meet.googleapis.com`), Apps Script (`script.googleapis.com`) and Workspace Events (`workspaceevents.googleapis.com`), plus Admin reports (`admin.googleapis.com`) for an account that enables `admin-reports`. `/gws-status` gives one link that enables them all for the account's services. A service whose API is off fails with `API_DISABLED`; the others still work.
- **Not in the default.** `admin-reports` needs a Workspace admin with the Reports privilege, and any other account's Reports calls fail with `ADMIN_PRIVILEGE_REQUIRED`, so the `default` account leaves it out; an admin adds a separate account for it ([admin.md](admin.md)). Model Armor is left out too: none of its helpers can run.
- **Account requirements.** Chat needs a Google Workspace account. The Apps Script API also needs the user's own switch at <https://script.google.com/home/usersettings>.

To ask for less, set `accounts` with only the services you use, or `access: "read"`, or choose Read-only in the form.

### Keep needs domain-wide delegation

Google grants the Keep API's scopes, `keep` and `keep.readonly`, only through [domain-wide delegation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/keep/api/guides), which a Workspace admin sets up. A person's own consent cannot grant them, and a sign-in that asks for one is refused as a whole with `Error 400: invalid_scope`. So:

- no access level requests a Keep scope, and the `default` account does not enable Keep;
- `gws_catalog` and `gws_schema` mark every Keep method `restriction: "domain-wide-delegation"`, and the scope check refuses one with a next step that says so;
- an account that enables `keep` shows **Needs domain-wide delegation: keep** in `/gws-status`, the TUI dialog and `gws_status`, its sign-in form says so, and `/gws-doctor` reports Keep `SKIPPED` with the reason.

If your admin has set up domain-wide delegation, enable `keep` (and the Keep API, `keep.googleapis.com`) and add the scopes yourself: `"scopes": ["keep"]`, or `["keep.readonly"]`, in `accounts.<alias>.scopes`. The doctor then probes Keep like any other service.

## What a sign-in requests

`access` is `"read"` (the default for an account you configure), `"write"` (the implicit `default` account), or a per-service map such as `{ "drive": "write" }`. A service a map omits stays read-only. Extra scopes on `accounts.<alias>.scopes` are always requested and always shown. Short names are accepted: `gmail.readonly` is stored as the scope URL.

Before a read or a plan, the plugin compares the operation's manifest scopes with the scopes Google granted. A miss fails with `AUTH_SCOPE_MISSING` and does not start `gws`. The next step is to sign in again and approve every scope Google lists, choosing Read and write when only that level requests the scope. A method only an app's own credentials can run, or one that needs domain-wide delegation (both listed below), fails with a next step that says why.

No access level requests `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`, Model Armor's only scope, which grants access to the whole Cloud project: none of the Model Armor helpers can run, and `gws_catalog` marks them not executable.

<!-- generated:scopes -->

Generated from `src/domain/scopes.ts` and `src/domain/restricted.ts` by `npm run docs:coverage`. Do not edit this section by hand.

Every interactive sign-in also requests the identity scopes `openid`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile`. A short name such as `gmail.readonly` is the same scope as `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`.

These methods accept nothing else, so no Google sign-in can run them; `gws_catalog` and `gws_schema` mark them `appOnly` and `restriction: "app-only"`:

Google grants `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/keep`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/keep.readonly` only through domain-wide delegation, which a Workspace admin sets up, never through a person's own consent: a sign-in that asks for one is refused with `invalid_scope`. No access level requests them, and the default account does not enable Keep. These methods accept nothing else; `gws_catalog` and `gws_schema` mark them `restriction: "domain-wide-delegation"`. An account whose admin has set up delegation adds the scopes in `accounts.<alias>.scopes`:

- `keep.media.download`
- `keep.notes.create`
- `keep.notes.delete`
- `keep.notes.get`
- `keep.notes.list`
- `keep.notes.permissions.batchCreate`
- `keep.notes.permissions.batchDelete`

## After sign-in

`/gws-status` and `gws_status` show, per account, the mode, access, client source (`account`, `plugin`, or `pasted`), granted scopes, the signed-in `email` and Workspace `domain`, scopes still missing for the enabled services, and a next step. The TUI status dialog shows the same fields except `email` and `domain`. The status RPC carries all of those account fields.

`email` and `domain` come from the `id_token` Google's token endpoint returns: the sign-in keeps two of its claims with its tokens, the email address, when Google says it is verified, as `email`, and the Workspace domain (`hd`) as `domain`, which a consumer account has none of. A refresh that returns an `id_token` updates them. Status shows both, so a host can tell which account and organisation is signed in; nothing else is read from the token, and neither decides what the plugin allows. A headless account has neither.
