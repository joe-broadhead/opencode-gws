# Status view, RPC, and commands

Unofficial plugin. Not affiliated with Google.

The TUI is one status dialog. It cannot approve or commit a plan. Neither can the RPC or the commands.

## Status dialog

The palette command **Google Workspace: Status**, or `/gws` in the prompt, opens one dialog. Nothing is always visible: the plugin adds no footer, sidebar or other slot. The dialog and `/gws-status` show the same rows, in this order:

| Row | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Connection | per account: `connected`, `sign-in required`, or `not configured` (a headless account whose environment variable is unset) |
| Account | the alias and how it signs in: OpenCode sign-in, credentials file, or access token |
| Access | `read-only` or `read and write`, then the client, services, and granted and missing scopes |
| Hidden skills | only when another skill file uses one of the plugin's skill ids, which hides the plugin's own: the id and that file |
| Shell gws skills | only when another skill teaches agents to run `gws` in a shell, which skips plans, approvals and policy: each id and its file |
| Tools | the services whose gws tools the model sees |
| Permissions | the posture from `access`: every tool runs without asking, each commit asks, or the commits are denied |
| Agents without default rules | their names, then the rules to put first in each agent's own `permissions` |
| OpenCode | the version, then `(tested)`, or `(host untested; supported range >=2.2.3 <2.3.0)` |
| Next step | exactly one; `Nothing to do.` when nothing is needed |

The key hint reads `r refresh · esc close`. The dialog listens for server reconnects and integration, credential and agent changes only while it is open. It loads nothing while closed, and it reads only the `status` RPC.

## Commands

Each command posts a message and does not start a model turn.

| Command | What it posts |
| --- | --- |
| `/gws-status` | The status model: each account's mode, access, client source, granted and missing scopes, and next step; the Google Cloud steps for accounts that have no OAuth client yet; this session's pending plans, redacted (category, operation, account, preview, expiry; never argv, a body, or a token); the permission posture, agents without the default rules, by name, then the rules to add first in each one's own permissions; and one next step. |
| `/gws-doctor` | One small read per enabled service per account. Reports `OK`, `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `AUTH_SCOPE_MISSING`, `ADMIN_PRIVILEGE_REQUIRED` (a valid sign-in without the admin privilege the service needs, with the next step), `API_DISABLED` (with the enable URL), `SKIPPED` (with the reason), or a denied `gws.read`. The summary counts every status but `OK` and `SKIPPED` as needing attention. |

`/gws-doctor` asks for `gws.read` on `<account>:<operation>` before each probe, the same way `gws_read` does. A refusal stops the run.

## RPC

Contract: `src/rpc.ts`, id `google-workspace.gws`, method `status` only. It is internal: the build inlines it into both `dist/index.js` and `dist/tui.js`, and the package exports only `.` and `./tui`.

`status` returns the fields every plugin's status RPC shares (`version`, `host`, `state`, `unguardedAgents`, `nextStep`), with the plugin's own beside them:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | This package's version. |
| `host` | `{ version, range, tested }`: the OpenCode version (`null` when unknown), the supported range `>=2.2.3 <2.3.0`, and `true` only for a tested release (2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5, 2.2.6). |
| `state` | `sign_in_required` when an interactive account needs signing in, `not_configured` when a headless account's variable is unset, else `connected`. An untested OpenCode release inside the range keeps this state; only `host.tested` and the OpenCode row mark it. |
| `access` | What the default rules allow, from the plugin option: `all`, `ask-changes` or `read-only`. The dialog and `/gws-status` show it as **Permissions**. |
| `gws` | `{ path, version }` of the resolved binary. |
| `services` | Model-facing services. |
| `accounts` | One entry per account, below. |
| `auditDegraded` | Present when the audit sink has failed. Omitted means false. |
| `shadowedSkills` | `[{ id, path }]`: skills OpenCode lists under one of the plugin's skill ids but from another file, so the plugin's own does not load. Present when any does. |
| `shellSkills` | `[{ id, path }]`: skills OpenCode lists, other than the plugin's own, whose text runs `gws` in a shell: a line in a fenced code block, or an inline code span, that starts with `gws ` and a word (`gws gmail +triage`). Prose that only names gws does not count. Present when any does. |
| `unguardedAgents` | Agents that missed the default rules while `access` holds something back, so a commit there runs without asking. Empty at `all`, where nothing is held back. |
| `permissionsBlock` | The JSON block to add first in each of those agents' own `permissions`. Present when `unguardedAgents` is not empty. |
| `nextStep` | The one thing to do next, as one sentence: an account's sign-in step, then a hidden skill, then the skills that run gws in a shell, then the unguarded agents. `Nothing to do.` when nothing is needed. |

An account entry is `{ alias, mode, services, integrationID?, connected, needsAuth?, access?, clientSource?, grantedScopes?, email?, domain?, missingScopes?, delegationRequired?, nextStep? }`. `email` and `domain` are the signed-in account's verified email and Workspace domain, from its sign-in's `id_token`. `delegationRequired` names the enabled services that need domain-wide delegation (Keep) when the interactive account's scopes do not add them; the dialog and `/gws-status` show it as **Needs domain-wide delegation**.

- `connected` is true when an interactive account is signed in and usable, or when a headless account's environment variable is set. `/gws-doctor` checks the headless credential itself.
- `needsAuth` is `true` or absent.
- `access` (on an account) is the signed-in level, or the form's default before sign-in.
- `clientSource` is `account`, `plugin`, or `pasted` (entered in the sign-in form).
- An account's `nextStep` is one sentence, absent when nothing is needed.

The RPC cannot approve or commit. A commit happens only when the agent calls a commit tool, which runs without a prompt at the default `access` and needs the permission prompt's allow at `ask-changes`.

Scripts call the tools through a separate RPC, `google-workspace.gws.tools`: see [Scripting](scripting.md).
